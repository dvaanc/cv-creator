# CV-Creator
 Part of the Odin Project curriculum.

## Project Overview
A web app where the user is able to create their own CV/Resume by filling in their personal details, education and work experience.

This project was the first time I learnt and used React extensively. I learnt state management, props, component lifecycle and hooks. Initially it was written using Class Components, then converted using function components.
